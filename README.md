# Den Browser

Den Browser is a simple (not modern) browser intended for the purpose of not logging or tracking you on any website. This project is also NOT supposed to be set as a defualt browser on your computer. You must use the browser if you want to and not all the time. Den-Browser also has a website to download the most stable, latest release. 

Den Browser is also a free browser, meaning that donations will come in handy to help the project. Den Browser is coded in C#.
